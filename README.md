Nik Martin's dotfiles
=====================

My dotfiles collection
----------------------

Contains various dotfiles that I have customized to suit my tastes. It also
conatins a script that symlinks all the files after pulling them to a new
computer via git. The files are structured such that 'at rest', the files are
not hidden.  Once makesymlinks.sh is run, symlinks that represent the files as
their applications expect them at runtime are created. The original files stay
in ~/dotfiles.
